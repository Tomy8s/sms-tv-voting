# README

1. Initialize Rails App.

2. Write rake file to import data - no data == no point, no front end == difficult, ugly experience (but still something if you've got the data!).  
Run `rake log_votes`, beware, it may take some time!

3. Create a UI, and think about useful functionality for the end user in the process.

4. Wire it all together!
